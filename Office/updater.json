	"how": "Those who have never freelanced may have an idealized idea of the freelancer lifestyle: waking up past noon and going to work on your couch without pants on. There is some truth to that—sometimes I work without pants on, I’ll admit it!—but this narrow-minded thinking still leaves much of the reality of freelancing in the dark.\nUnfortunately, you usually learn the most important lessons the hard way. I’ve been freelancing now for over ten years, first as a proofreader, then an editor and now as a writer. And I have to say, most of my success has been built upon the blunders, missteps and flat-out failures of my early years. And as a  “welcome” to the new wave of freelancers, I’ve reflected on the 7 truths about freelancing that I wish I’d known before I started.\nTake these tips to heart—put them on a post-it note! Tape them to your computer screen!—so you don’t make the same freelancing mistakes I did."
